# Trash-classification
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on augmented trash images to classify waste into different categories (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, etc.). It features a web interface built using HTML/CSS/JS and a FastAPI backend for real-time image classification.
